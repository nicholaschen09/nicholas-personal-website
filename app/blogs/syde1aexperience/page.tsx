                The jump from high school to university engineering was
                significant. The pace is faster, the material more complex, and
                the expectations much higher. In high school, I was used to
                being guided through most learning processes, but university
                demanded more independence and self-directed study.

                Time management became crucial as I juggled multiple deadlines,

                liberating and challenging â€“ no one was checking if I attended
                lectures or completed readings, but the consequences of falling
                behind were entirely on me.

              <p>
                Living at Conrad Muller Hall was a significant part of my
                first-year experience. The residence provided a supportive
                community of fellow engineering students facing similar
                challenges.
              </p>
              <p>
                The suite-style rooms offered a good balance of privacy and
                social interaction. Late-night study sessions in common areas,
                impromptu pizza parties, and the convenience of being close to
                classes made CMH an ideal home during my first year.
              </p>
              <p>
                The residence advisors organized regular events that helped
                break the monotony of academic life and fostered connections
                among residents.

          <p>
            The cohort-based structure of SYDE meant I spent most of my time
            with the same group of about 100 students. This created an
            environment where deep friendships formed naturally. Study groups
            evolved into friend groups, and collaborative projects led to
            lasting connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            These friendships were crucial for navigating the challenges of
            first year. We supported each other through difficult assignments,
            celebrated successes together, and provided emotional support during
            stressful periods like midterms and finals.

                One of the highlights of SYDE 1A was participating in design
                projects that applied theoretical knowledge to practical
                problems. These projects included:

                offered a refreshing break from theoretical coursework.

            The University of Waterloo campus became my second home during 1A.
            Beyond the Engineering buildings where most of my classes took
            place, I discovered many favorite spots:

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2">
            <li>

            <li>
              The Engineering C&D - where I fueled late-night study sessions

              <p>
                Even in 1A, co-op preparation was a significant focus. The
                Waterloo co-op program is renowned for providing valuable work
                experience, and preparation began early:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2">
                <li>Resume workshops and critiques</li>

              <p className="mt-2">
                While the first co-op term was still months away, the groundwork

                process.

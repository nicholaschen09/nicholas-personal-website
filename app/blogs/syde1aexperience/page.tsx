            Starting my journey in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo was both exciting and
            challenging. The first academic term, known as 1A, was a whirlwind of new experiences, rigorous coursework,
            and valuable lessons.

              <p>
                The jump from high school to university engineering was significant. The pace is faster, the material
                more complex, and the expectations much higher. In high school, I was used to being guided through most
                learning processes, but university demanded more independence and self-directed study.
              </p>
              <p>
                Time management became crucial as I juggled multiple deadlines, readings, and projects simultaneously.
                The freedom was both liberating and challenging â€“ no one was checking if I attended lectures or
                completed readings, but the consequences of falling behind were entirely on me.

            <div>
              <p>
                Living at Conrad Muller Hall was a significant part of my first-year experience. The residence provided
                a supportive community of fellow engineering students facing similar challenges.
              </p>
              <p>
                The suite-style rooms offered a good balance of privacy and social interaction. Late-night study
                sessions in common areas, impromptu pizza parties, and the convenience of being close to classes made
                CMH an ideal home during my first year.
              </p>
              <p>
                The residence advisors organized regular events that helped break the monotony of academic life and
                fostered connections among residents.

          <p>
            The cohort-based structure of SYDE meant I spent most of my time with the same group of about 100 students.
            This created an environment where deep friendships formed naturally. Study groups evolved into friend
            groups, and collaborative projects led to lasting connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            These friendships were crucial for navigating the challenges of first year. We supported each other through
            difficult assignments, celebrated successes together, and provided emotional support during stressful
            periods like midterms and finals.

                One of the highlights of SYDE 1A was participating in design projects that applied theoretical knowledge
                to practical problems. These projects included:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2">
                <li>Designing and building a small-scale autonomous vehicle</li>
                <li>Creating user interfaces for specific accessibility needs</li>
                <li>Developing solutions for community-identified problems</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mt-2">
                These projects provided valuable experience in teamwork, project management, and the engineering design
                process. They also offered a refreshing break from theoretical coursework.

          <p>
            The University of Waterloo campus became my second home during 1A. Beyond the Engineering buildings where
            most of my classes took place, I discovered many favorite spots:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2">
            <li>The Davis Centre Library - perfect for focused study sessions</li>
            <li>The Student Life Centre - a hub for socializing and club activities</li>
            <li>The Engineering C&D - where I fueled late-night study sessions with coffee</li>
            <li>The paths around Laurel Creek - ideal for clearing my mind between classes</li>
          </ul>

          {/* Co-op Section */}

            <div>
              <p>
                Even in 1A, co-op preparation was a significant focus. The Waterloo co-op program is renowned for
                providing valuable work experience, and preparation began early:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2">
                <li>Resume workshops and critiques</li>
                <li>Mock interviews and feedback sessions</li>
                <li>Co-op information sessions with upper-year students</li>
                <li>Building relevant skills through coursework and projects</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mt-2">
                While the first co-op term was still months away, the groundwork laid in 1A was essential for future
                success in the job search process.

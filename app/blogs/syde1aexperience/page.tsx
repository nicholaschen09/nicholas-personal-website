                The jump from high school to university engineering was
                significant. The pace is faster, the material more complex, and
                the expectations much higher. In high school, I was used to
                being guided through most learning processes, but university
                demanded more independence and self-directed study.

                Time management became crucial as I juggled multiple deadlines,

                liberating and challenging â€“ no one was checking if I attended
                lectures or completed readings, but the consequences of falling
                behind were entirely on me.

                        Dr. Thompson was an incredible professor who made
                        calculus surprisingly engaging. She had a knack for
                        breaking down complex concepts into understandable
                        pieces and always connected the math to real engineering
                        applications. Her office hours were incredibly helpful,
                        and she was always willing to spend extra time with
                        students who were struggling.

                      <p>
                        The course was taught through a combination of lectures
                        (3 hours per week) and tutorials (1 hour per week). Dr.
                        Thompson used a tablet to write out problems in
                        real-time, which was much better than pre-made slides.
                        She would often pause to ask questions and make sure
                        everyone was following along. The tutorials were led by
                        TAs who would work through practice problems and provide
                        additional help.

                      <p>
                        This was one of the more challenging courses for me in
                        1A. The pace was much faster than high school calculus,
                        and we covered a lot more material. I found myself
                        spending about 6-8 hours per week on the problem sets,
                        which were challenging but really helped solidify my
                        understanding. The midterms were tough but fair, and I
                        ended up forming a study group with four classmates
                        which made a huge difference in my understanding and
                        final grade.

                      <p>
                        The most valuable part of this course was learning how
                        calculus applies to engineering problems. We worked on
                        optimization problems, fluid flow calculations, and even
                        some basic physics applications that showed how this
                        math would be useful in our future careers.

                      </h4>
                      <p>
                        This was my favorite course in 1A! I had some
                        programming experience from high school, but C++ was new
                        to me. The learning curve was steep at first, especially
                        with memory management and pointers, but the hands-on
                        approach of the course made it click for me after a few
                        weeks.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The projects were challenging but incredibly rewarding.
                        Our first project was building a simple text-based game,
                        and the second was creating a data analysis tool for
                        engineering measurements. I spent countless late nights
                        in the lab with classmates debugging code and
                        celebrating when we finally got things working. These
                        collaborative experiences were some of my best memories
                        from the term.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The most valuable skill I gained wasn't just the C++
                        syntax, but the problem-solving approach that
                        programming teaches you. Breaking down complex problems
                        into smaller, manageable pieces is a skill that has
                        helped me in every other course.

                      <p>
                        Dr. Williams was a structural engineer with decades of
                        experience designing bridges and buildings. His
                        practical knowledge made the theoretical concepts much
                        more tangible. He would often bring in physical models
                        and demonstrations to help us visualize the forces at
                        work, which was incredibly helpful for understanding
                        abstract concepts.

                      <p>
                        The course had three 1-hour lectures per week and a
                        2-hour tutorial. Dr. Williams used a combination of
                        slides and board work, often drawing free-body diagrams
                        by hand to show the process of analyzing forces. The
                        tutorials were problem-solving sessions where we worked
                        through more complex examples with TA guidance. What
                        made this course special was the physical demonstrations
                        - Dr. Williams would bring in trusses, beams, and other
                        structures to show us real-world applications.

                      <p>
                        Statics was conceptually challenging for me at first.
                        The idea of analyzing forces in 3D space took some time
                        to grasp, but once it clicked, I found the
                        problem-solving process almost like a puzzle. The course
                        required a lot of practice - I found myself redoing
                        problems multiple times until I fully understood the
                        approach.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        One of the most interesting parts was our bridge design
                        mini-project, where we had to analyze the forces in a
                        truss bridge and optimize the design for maximum
                        strength with minimal materials. Seeing the practical
                        application of the theory made the course much more
                        engaging.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Dr. Williams' real-world examples from his engineering
                        career showed us how these concepts apply to actual
                        structures. Learning about bridge failures due to
                        improper force analysis was both sobering and motivating
                        - it showed the real importance of understanding these
                        principles thoroughly.

                        professor, so she could connect mathematical theory to
                        real engineering applications. Her enthusiasm for the
                        material was contagious, and she was always available
                        during office hours to help students who were

                      <p>
                        This course covered a wide range of mathematical topics,
                        which made it both challenging and interesting. Linear
                        algebra was entirely new to me, and I found the concept
                        of vector spaces and transformations particularly
                        difficult to grasp at first. The visualization tools Dr.
                        Patel provided were incredibly helpful - seeing how
                        matrices transform shapes in space made the abstract
                        concepts much more concrete.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The differential equations portion of the course was
                        fascinating because we could see how these equations
                        model real-world systems like spring-mass systems,
                        electrical circuits, and population growth. Working
                        through these applications helped me understand why
                        these mathematical tools are so important for engineers.

                      <p>
                        One of the most valuable aspects of this course was
                        learning MATLAB for numerical computations. We used it
                        to solve systems of equations, visualize vector fields,
                        and simulate differential equations. This computational
                        approach complemented the theoretical understanding and
                        gave us practical tools we could apply in other courses
                        and projects.

                      <p>
                        Prof. Martinez had a background in both engineering and
                        professional communications, having worked as a
                        technical writer for several major tech companies before
                        joining academia. Her industry experience gave her
                        insights into what makes technical communication
                        effective in real-world settings. She was approachable
                        and provided detailed feedback on all our assignments,
                        which was incredibly valuable for improving our writing.

                        The course had one 2-hour lecture and one 1-hour
                        workshop each week. Lectures covered communication
                        principles, document structure, presentation techniques,
                        and professional writing standards. The workshops were
                        interactive sessions where we practiced what we learned
                        through peer reviews, group activities, and presentation
                        rehearsals. Prof. Martinez created a supportive
                        environment where we felt comfortable giving and
                        receiving feedback.

                        My Experience:
                      </h4>
                      <p>
                        Many students underestimated this course, thinking it
                        would be easy compared to the technical courses, but it
                        was surprisingly challenging and incredibly valuable.
                        Learning to communicate complex technical ideas clearly
                        is a skill that's essential for engineers but often
                        overlooked.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The most challenging assignment for me was the technical
                        presentation. Public speaking had always made me
                        nervous, but the structured approach we learned and the
                        supportive feedback from classmates helped me improve
                        significantly. By the end of the term, I felt much more
                        confident presenting my ideas.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The engineering report was a comprehensive project where
                        we had to research a technical topic, analyze data, and
                        present recommendations. I chose to write about
                        renewable energy integration in urban environments. The
                        process of researching, organizing, and clearly
                        presenting complex information taught me skills I've
                        used in every course since.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        What made this course particularly effective was how it
                        integrated with our other courses. We often used
                        projects or topics from our technical courses as the
                        subject matter for our communications assignments, which
                        reinforced both sets of learning.

                        Prof. Kim had an interesting background that combined

                        worked for several automotive companies designing
                        vehicle components before becoming a professor. His dual
                        expertise in both the technical and aesthetic aspects of
                        design gave him a unique perspective that made the

                        This was primarily a lab-based course with one 1-hour

                        lectures introduced concepts and techniques, while the
                        labs were hands-on sessions where we practiced these
                        skills with immediate feedback. Prof. Kim would
                        demonstrate techniques on a projected screen, then walk
                        around the lab helping students individually as we

                        My Experience:
                      </h4>
                      <p>
                        This course was a perfect complement to the verbal
                        communication skills we learned in SYDE 101. I
                        discovered that visual communication is just as
                        important for engineers - sometimes a well- crafted
                        diagram or model can explain a concept better than
                        paragraphs of text.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The course started with hand sketching, which was
                        challenging for someone like me with limited artistic
                        ability. We learned techniques for perspective drawing,
                        isometric sketching, and rapid visualization. These
                        skills were surprisingly useful for quickly
                        communicating ideas during team meetings and design
                        sessions.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The CAD portion of the course introduced us to
                        SolidWorks, which was both challenging and rewarding.
                        Learning to create precise 3D models took practice, but
                        seeing my designs come to life on screen was incredibly
                        satisfying. We progressed from modeling simple objects
                        to creating complex assemblies with moving parts.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The final project brought everything together - we had
                        to design a mechanical device, create detailed CAD
                        models, produce technical drawings with proper
                        dimensioning and tolerances, and present our design
                        visually. I designed an adjustable laptop stand with
                        cooling features, and the process of taking an
                        adjustable laptop stand with cooling features, and the
                        process of taking it from initial concept sketches to
                        detailed technical drawings taught me the entire visual
                        communication workflow that engineers use in industry.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        What I appreciated most about this course was how
                        practical and applicable the skills were. In our other
                        engineering courses, we could immediately apply these
                        visual communication techniques to present our work more
                        effectively. These skills have continued to be valuable
                        in team projects, where clear visual communication is
                        essential for collaboration.

                        engineering with human factors and design thinking.
                        Before academia, she worked at IDEO, one of the world's
                        leading design firms, where she helped develop products
                        for companies like Apple and Samsung. Her industry
                        experience brought a practical, real-world perspective
                        to the course that made the design process feel tangible
                        rather than theoretical.

                        This course was structured differently from our other
                        courses, with one 2-hour lecture and one 3-hour studio
                        session each week. The lectures introduced design
                        principles, methodologies, and case studies, while the
                        studio sessions were dedicated to hands-on design work
                        in teams. Dr. Nguyen created an active learning
                        environment where we were constantly applying concepts
                        through activities, discussions, and mini-design
                        challenges.

                        My Experience:
                      </h4>
                      <p>
                        SYDE 161 was the course that most embodied what makes
                        Systems Design Engineering unique. While other
                        engineering disciplines might focus primarily on
                        technical solutions, this course taught us to start with
                        understanding human needs and designing holistic
                        solutions that consider the entire system.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The course began with learning design research methods -
                        we conducted user interviews, observations, and created
                        empathy maps to understand the people we were designing
                        for. This human-centered approach was eye-opening for
                        me, as I had previously thought of engineering primarily
                        in technical terms.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Working in teams of four, we tackled a semester-long
                        design project focused on improving campus accessibility
                        for students with disabilities. My team focused
                        specifically on navigation challenges for visually
                        impaired students. We went through the entire design
                        process - from research and problem definition to
                        ideation, prototyping, testing, and refinement.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The most valuable lesson from this course was learning
                        to embrace iteration and feedback. Our first prototypes
                        were far from perfect, but through user testing and
                        continuous refinement, our final solution (a combination
                        of tactile maps and a smartphone app with audio
                        guidance) evolved into something genuinely useful. Dr.
                        Nguyen emphasized that good design rarely happens in a
                        single attempt - it's a process of learning and
                        improving through multiple iterations.

                        This course changed how I think about engineering
                        problems. I now approach challenges by first
                        understanding the human context and needs before jumping
                        to technical solutions - a perspective that has proven
                        valuable in all my subsequent courses and projects.

                      A seminar course focused on preparing students
                      academically and personally for their first year in
                      engineering. The course addresses study skills, time

                        Prof. Wilson was a mechanical engineering professor who
                        also served as the first-year engineering advisor. His
                        genuine concern for student well-being was evident in
                        every session. Having taught this course for over a
                        decade, he had seen firsthand the challenges that
                        first-year students face and had developed effective
                        strategies to help us navigate them.

                        This course met once a week for a 2-hour seminar
                        session. Unlike our other courses, GENE 119 was much
                        more discussion-based and interactive. Prof. Wilson
                        would introduce topics and facilitate conversations, but
                        much of the learning came from peer discussions and
                        shared experiences. The small class size (about 25
                        students) created a comfortable environment where people
                        felt safe sharing their challenges and asking questions.

                      </h4>
                      <p>
                        Initially, many students (including myself)
                        underestimated the importance of this course, viewing it
                        as less critical than our technical courses. However, as
                        the term progressed, I came to appreciate how valuable
                        these sessions were for maintaining balance and
                        perspective during a challenging first term.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The course covered practical skills like effective
                        note-taking, study strategies for different types of
                        courses, time management techniques, and stress
                        management practices. We also learned about campus
                        resources like the writing center, counseling services,
                        and academic advisors - resources I might not have
                        discovered or utilized otherwise.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        One of the most valuable aspects of the course was the
                        community it created. Hearing that other students were
                        facing similar challenges made me feel less alone in my
                        struggles. We shared strategies for managing workload,
                        dealing with difficult concepts, and maintaining
                        well-being amid academic pressures.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The reflection journals encouraged us to think
                        critically about our learning processes and personal
                        growth. This practice of self-reflection helped me
                        identify patterns in my study habits and make
                        adjustments that improved my performance in other
                        courses. For example, I realized I was spending too much
                        time on detailed notes and not enough on practice
                        problems, which led me to adjust my approach for
                        midterms.

                      <p>
                        Looking back, GENE 119 provided a crucial foundation for
                        success not just in 1A, but throughout my engineering
                        education. The skills and habits developed in this
                        course have continued to serve me well in managing
                        increasingly complex coursework and projects.

                classes made CMH an ideal home during my first year.

                The residence advisors organized regular events that helped
                break the monotony of academic life and fostered connections
                among residents.

            The cohort-based structure of SYDE meant I spent most of my time
            with the same group of about 100 students. This created an
            environment where deep friendships formed naturally. Study groups
            evolved into friend groups, and collaborative projects led to
            lasting connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            These friendships were crucial for navigating the challenges of
            first year. We supported each other through difficult assignments,
            celebrated successes together, and provided emotional support during
            stressful periods like midterms and finals.

                One of the highlights of SYDE 1A was participating in design
                projects that applied theoretical knowledge to practical
                problems. These projects included:

              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2">
                <li>Designing and building a small-scale autonomous vehicle</li>

                These projects provided valuable experience in teamwork, project
                management, and the engineering design process. They also
                offered a refreshing break from theoretical coursework.

            The University of Waterloo campus became my second home during 1A.
            Beyond the Engineering buildings where most of my classes took
            place, I discovered many favorite spots:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2">
            <li>
              The Davis Centre Library - perfect for focused study sessions

              The Student Life Centre - a hub for socializing and club
              activities
            </li>
            <li>
              The Engineering C&D - where I fueled late-night study sessions
              with coffee
            </li>
            <li>
              The paths around Laurel Creek - ideal for clearing my mind between

              <p>
                Even in 1A, co-op preparation was a significant focus. The
                Waterloo co-op program is renowned for providing valuable work
                experience, and preparation began early:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2">
                <li>Resume workshops and critiques</li>
                <li>Mock interviews and feedback sessions</li>
                <li>Co-op information sessions with upper-year students</li>
                <li>
                  Building relevant skills through coursework and projects
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mt-2">
                While the first co-op term was still months away, the groundwork
                laid in 1A was essential for future success in the job search
                process.
